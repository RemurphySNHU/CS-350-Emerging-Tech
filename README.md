    What did you do particularly well?

    With these projects, I excelled at interpretting the libraries needed to comply with functionality guidelines.  These Projects were very fun for me because firmware development is one of     my main career goals.  I enjoy working with actual hardware.

    Where could you improve?

    I could definitely improve my understanding of the embedded system C language data types.  Types like int16_t vs int and their respective pros and cons need to be clarified for me.  I have performed my own research within the development community, but still am lacking the insight to really harness the datatypes and thus use the mocrocontroller as efficiently as possible as is their function.

    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

    While working on these projects, I learned how to better understand the documentation associated with microcontrollers.  Also, I discoverd a great new editor that is far leaner than Vscode or Eclipse, SublimeText.  This editor helped me to better understand certain new library functions in order to port the older project and keep it functional.

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

    I think all of these projects provided the experience I needed to take on bigger challenges professionally.  I have always wanted to get into DSP with repect to the audio world.  Understanding how to connect measuring devices, or signal generators to the GPIO, properly, will assist with these future goals.  

    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    For the final thermostat project, I had to correct some of the outdated cource material before it could be functional at all.  A macro was introduced in this project used to display all data that was designed with a depreciated UART library.  This presented a lot of troubleshooting opportunity!  While it was frustraating at first, I gradually gained momentum and rewrote the project so that it actually functioned.  I also made sure to document the specific functions/moacros etc that were changed and what exactly I changed with them.  This includes leaving many in-line comments within the new code to explain why the changed were necessary.
